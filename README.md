# Entrepreneurial Cities Index (ICE) 2023

The Entrepreneurial Cities Index analyzes the business environment of the 100+1 most populous cities in Brazil to assess which ones have the most favorable conditions for entrepreneurship. To do so, the municipalities are analyzed through 48 indicators, divided into 7 determinants: regulatory environment, infrastructure, market, access to capital, innovation, human capital, and culture.

The indicators are calculated from primary data (collected directly) and secondary data (derived from other research and already published databases), and are subsequently standardized and weighted through factor analysis, which allows us to assess how variations in that indicator contribute to the final result.

Thus, the final ranking is calculated exclusively based on numerical data. No qualitative information or subjective perception of the researchers interferes in the classification of a city in the Index. The specific policies or programs implemented by a municipality will only be reflected in the city's classification in the Index if they cause (positive or negative) effects on any of the indicators analyzed in the study.
